# CrossDBMicroExpressionRec
The codes are used for recognizing micro-expressions over the cross-database in MEGC2019.

This package is a MATLAB implementation of our paper "Cross-database Micro-Expression Recognition With Deep Convolutional Networks
".

The code is supplied for educational and research purposes only. Please cite our paper if you use any part of the code or data on the project web page. Please contact the authors below if you wish to use the code commercially.

The code was written in MATLAB R2018b, and tested on Windows 10. The code currently also requires MATLAB's Computer Vision Toolbox and MatConvNet (Beta25). We hope to remove this dependency in the future.

For questions/feedback/bugs, or if you would like to make commercial use of this software, please contact Dr. Zhaoqiang Xia <zxia@nwpu.edu.cn>, Northwestern Polytechnical University
